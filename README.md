# periodic-lbm

A private collection of research codes for lattice Boltzmann methods in periodic 2D domains.

For actual simulation work see the section [Other codes](/other_codes)

## Data layout 

When organizing an LBM code, there are two main choices for the data layout
- structure of arrays (SoA), and
- array of structures (AoS)
The chosen layout has important performance implications. 
For optimum performance the kernels should be specialized for the chosen layout. 

In the SoA layout, the PDF's in a given direction at different spatial points are stored contiguosly. 
In the AoS layout the PDF's pointing in different directions at a single spatial point are stored contiguously.
